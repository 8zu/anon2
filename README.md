# Anon2

A much simpler but more robust bot for anonymous posting than [anon-bot](https://github.com/8zu/anon-bot).

## How to use

Clone and Host your own anon-bot. Invite it to your server with the permission to

1. Send message
2. Manage message

Then at the (one) channel you (owner) want it to post anonymously in, type `Please subscribe to here.`. The bot will indicate that it has subscribed to the channel.

After that, any post in the channel will be swiftly removed and reposted by the bot anonymously. The message will be logged in a file but not the screen so that only the hoster can access it, potentially for purpose of working against spamming.

The header has the same format as [anon-bot](https://github.com/8zu/anon-bot).
